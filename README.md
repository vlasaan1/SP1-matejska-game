Collaborated in a team of 6 to develop a set of games for 1-3 players for an interactive board using <b>C# and Unity</b> as an assignment for software team project class.
The goal was to design an simple game for people coming to try the interactive board on Open Door days. This came to be a <b>set of short minigames</b> in one game.


This project taught us the ability to collaborate and communicate effectively in a team environment with differently focused sub-teams and regular bi-weekly sessions.
